# Darksiders Genesis Enhanced PC Mod

Modern runtime enhancements for **Darksiders Genesis (PC)** using a local x64
DXGI proxy and ASI plugin.

The project is deliberately fail-open for normal runtime failures and
**fail-closed for unsupported game executables**.

## Current development state

- Stable/canonical `main`: **V0.13B**
- Current cleanup/test branch: **V0.17 Core Cleanup**
- Target executable:

```text
DarksidersGenesis-Win64-Shipping.exe
Size: 62,113,280 bytes
SHA-256: 9f4702024df5eea1d51df7745b0ad1ea95b97009982f73ddc1218c53dff33d54
```

V0.17 calculates the executable SHA-256 at runtime. If the executable does not
match exactly, the overlay/log can still load but **gameplay hooks are not
installed**.

## Installation

Copy these files next to the game executable:

```text
dxgi.dll
DarksidersGenesisMod.asi
DarksidersGenesisMod.ini
```

Launch the game normally.

Default overlay key:

```text
Insert
```

The menu key and F1-F12 actions can be remapped from the overlay.

## Feature status

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| D3D11 / ImGui overlay | Stable |
| Rebindable menu key | Stable |
| Toggle HUD | Validated |
| Movement Speed | Validated; V0.17B restores the proven V0.14F local-pawn + Jump/Glide identity path |
| Action Recovery | Validated V0.8B tail-only policy |
| Jump Height | Validated |
| Glide / Flight Duration | Validated |
| Skip Intro | Validated |
| Hotstreak Charge | Validated |
| Pistol Damage | Functional heuristic: `BaseJuice > 0` |
| Melee Damage | Experimental heuristic: zero-juice outgoing records |
| Horse Speed | Test candidate, reference-PAK signature |
| Horse Sprint Duration | Test candidate, stamina-drain control |
| Horse Sprint Speed | Not implemented |
| FOV | Not implemented |
| Third Person camera | Not implemented |
| Skip Logos | Paused after rejected V0.15 experiments |

Unimplemented controls are disabled in the V0.17 overlay/default configuration
instead of pretending to be active.

## Default hotkeys

```text
F1  Toggle HUD
F2  Movement Speed
F3  Action Recovery
F4  Skip Intro Videos
F5-F12  None
```

## V0.17 core architecture

The cleanup branch separates the runtime into explicit modules:

```text
dxgi_proxy.cpp
    local DXGI forwarding + ASI loading

DarksidersGenesisMod.cpp
    active hook orchestration + D3D11 renderer integration

ConfigStore.cpp
    INI + hotkeys + debounced persistence

RuntimeSettings.cpp
    atomic gameplay settings consumed by hook threads

TargetValidator.cpp
    exact executable size/SHA-256 gate

OverlayUi.cpp
    ImGui menu only, using an explicit context

HorseFeature.cpp
    isolated horse candidate logic
```

Historical/rejected hook families are no longer compiled into the runtime core.

## Horse reference

The authoritative horse research source is the user-supplied working reference
mod:

```text
ZZZ-Horse_P.pak
SHA-256: 3719ac840e1d0d7f137c9322580a3abe58cc5cf93d4b1ea97352c66490d3a920
```

Proven vanilla -> modified values include:

```text
MaxWalkSpeed                       1300 -> 1500
MaxAcceleration                     600 -> 700
BrakingFrictionFactor                 1 -> 2
GallopSpawnSpeedThreshold            300 -> 400

StaminaRecoveryPercentageRate         15 -> 100
StaminaTotalRecoveryPercentageRate    40 -> 100
StaminaSprintPercentageRate           25 -> 0
```

See `docs/REFERENCE_PAK_AUDIT.md` for the complete reference audit.

## Configuration behavior

Gameplay hook threads do not read the editable UI config directly.

V0.17 publishes settings into atomic runtime values immediately. INI persistence
is debounced, so dragging a slider no longer rewrites the entire file every
render frame.

The explicit **Save** button still persists immediately.

## Documentation

- `docs/FULL_AUDIT_V0.16A.md` - audit that triggered the V0.17 cleanup
- `docs/CORE_CLEANUP_V0.17.md` - V0.17 implementation / verification report
- `docs/REFERENCE_PAK_AUDIT.md` - supplied reference mod findings
- `docs/DODGE_RECOVERY_AUDIT.md` - recovery investigation
- `docs/TECHNICAL_NOTEBOOK.md` - complete historical development notebook

## Build

The project uses CMake and GitHub Actions.

MinHook and Dear ImGui are pinned to exact upstream commits for reproducible
builds.

The test artifact remains a flat package containing:

```text
dxgi.dll
DarksidersGenesisMod.asi
DarksidersGenesisMod.ini
README.md
```

## Release policy

Experimental branches are preserved as technical history.

`main` is not advanced merely because a candidate compiles. Gameplay changes
must be validated in game before promotion.


## V0.17B player-identity rollback fix

The first V0.17 cleanup introduced a new structural identity heuristic using
MaxWalkSpeed / MaxAcceleration. Runtime testing proved that heuristic rejected
the real player and therefore blocked Movement Speed, Jump, Glide and all
features depending on the captured local-player pointer.

V0.17B removes that unvalidated module completely and restores the path already
proven in V0.14F:

```text
APawn::IsLocallyControlled
  + valid JumpZ
  + valid DoubleJumpZ
  + valid GlideDuration
  = local player movement component
```

Only after that proven movement signature succeeds is
`g_localPlayerCharacter` updated.

The V0.17 cleanup work for target validation, atomic runtime settings,
ConfigStore, OverlayUi, debounced INI persistence, shutdown and dead-code
removal is retained.
