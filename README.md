# Darksiders Genesis Enhanced PC Mod

Modern runtime enhancements for **Darksiders Genesis (PC)** using a local x64
DXGI proxy and ASI plugin.

The project is deliberately fail-open for normal runtime failures and
**fail-closed for unsupported game executables**.

## Current development state

- Stable/canonical `main`: **V0.13B**
- Current cleanup/test branch: **V0.17 Core Cleanup**
- Target executable:

```text
DarksidersGenesis-Win64-Shipping.exe
Size: 62,113,280 bytes
SHA-256: 9f4702024df5eea1d51df7745b0ad1ea95b97009982f73ddc1218c53dff33d54
```

V0.17 calculates the executable SHA-256 at runtime. If the executable does not
match exactly, the overlay/log can still load but **gameplay hooks are not
installed**.

## Installation

Copy these files next to the game executable:

```text
dxgi.dll
DarksidersGenesisMod.asi
DarksidersGenesisMod.ini
```

Launch the game normally.

Default overlay key:

```text
Insert
```

The menu key and F1-F12 actions can be remapped from the overlay.

## Feature status

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| D3D11 / ImGui overlay | Stable |
| Rebindable menu key | Stable |
| Toggle HUD | Validated |
| Movement Speed | Validated; V0.17B restores the proven V0.14F local-pawn + Jump/Glide identity path |
| Action Recovery | Validated V0.8B tail-only policy |
| Jump Height | Validated |
| Glide / Flight Duration | Validated |
| Skip Intro | Validated |
| Hotstreak Charge | Validated |
| Pistol Damage | Functional heuristic: `BaseJuice > 0` |
| Melee Damage | Experimental heuristic: zero-juice outgoing records |
| Horse Speed | Test candidate, reference-PAK signature |
| Horse Sprint Duration | Test candidate, stamina-drain control |
| Horse Sprint Speed | Not implemented |
| FOV | Not implemented |
| Third Person camera | Not implemented |
| Skip Logos | V0.18B test, independent boot option, ON by default |

Unimplemented controls are disabled in the V0.17 overlay/default configuration
instead of pretending to be active.

## Default hotkeys

```text
F1  Toggle HUD
F2  Movement Speed
F3  Action Recovery
F4  Skip Intro Videos
F5-F12  None
```

## V0.17 core architecture

The cleanup branch separates the runtime into explicit modules:

```text
dxgi_proxy.cpp
    local DXGI forwarding + ASI loading

DarksidersGenesisMod.cpp
    active hook orchestration + D3D11 renderer integration

ConfigStore.cpp
    INI + hotkeys + debounced persistence

RuntimeSettings.cpp
    atomic gameplay settings consumed by hook threads

TargetValidator.cpp
    exact executable size/SHA-256 gate

OverlayUi.cpp
    ImGui menu only, using an explicit context

HorseFeature.cpp
    isolated horse candidate logic
```

Historical/rejected hook families are no longer compiled into the runtime core.

## Horse reference

The authoritative horse research source is the user-supplied working reference
mod:

```text
ZZZ-Horse_P.pak
SHA-256: 3719ac840e1d0d7f137c9322580a3abe58cc5cf93d4b1ea97352c66490d3a920
```

Proven vanilla -> modified values include:

```text
MaxWalkSpeed                       1300 -> 1500
MaxAcceleration                     600 -> 700
BrakingFrictionFactor                 1 -> 2
GallopSpawnSpeedThreshold            300 -> 400

StaminaRecoveryPercentageRate         15 -> 100
StaminaTotalRecoveryPercentageRate    40 -> 100
StaminaSprintPercentageRate           25 -> 0
```

See `docs/REFERENCE_PAK_AUDIT.md` for the complete reference audit.

## Configuration behavior

Gameplay hook threads do not read the editable UI config directly.

V0.17 publishes settings into atomic runtime values immediately. INI persistence
is debounced, so dragging a slider no longer rewrites the entire file every
render frame.

The explicit **Save** button still persists immediately.

## Documentation

- `docs/FULL_AUDIT_V0.16A.md` - audit that triggered the V0.17 cleanup
- `docs/CORE_CLEANUP_V0.17.md` - V0.17 implementation / verification report
- `docs/REFERENCE_PAK_AUDIT.md` - supplied reference mod findings
- `docs/DODGE_RECOVERY_AUDIT.md` - recovery investigation
- `docs/TECHNICAL_NOTEBOOK.md` - complete historical development notebook

## Build

The project uses CMake and GitHub Actions.

MinHook and Dear ImGui are pinned to exact upstream commits for reproducible
builds.

The test artifact remains a flat package containing:

```text
dxgi.dll
DarksidersGenesisMod.asi
DarksidersGenesisMod.ini
README.md
```

## Release policy

Experimental branches are preserved as technical history.

`main` is not advanced merely because a candidate compiles. Gameplay changes
must be validated in game before promotion.


## V0.17B player-identity rollback fix

The first V0.17 cleanup introduced a new structural identity heuristic using
MaxWalkSpeed / MaxAcceleration. Runtime testing proved that heuristic rejected
the real player and therefore blocked Movement Speed, Jump, Glide and all
features depending on the captured local-player pointer.

V0.17B removes that unvalidated module completely and restores the path already
proven in V0.14F:

```text
APawn::IsLocallyControlled
  + valid JumpZ
  + valid DoubleJumpZ
  + valid GlideDuration
  = local player movement component
```

Only after that proven movement signature succeeds is
`g_localPlayerCharacter` updated.

The V0.17 cleanup work for target validation, atomic runtime settings,
ConfigStore, OverlayUi, debounced INI persistence, shutdown and dead-code
removal is retained.


## Working rule / fil rouge

From this point forward the project follows a deliberately simple rule:

1. Keep validated behavior unless a test proves it wrong.
2. Do not add a second heuristic when an already validated path exists.
3. A feature owns one clear primitive and one clear responsibility.
4. Diagnostics must be bounded and must not become fallback trees.
5. Rejected experiments are removed from runtime code and kept in Git/docs.
6. Change one gameplay subject at a time.
7. The cumulative README records every accepted direction change and rejection.

### V0.17B final player rollback policy

Player identity is restored exactly to the previously validated V0.14F rule:

```text
APawn::IsLocallyControlled(characterOwner)
    -> g_localPlayerCharacter = characterOwner
```

JumpZ / DoubleJumpZ / GlideDuration validation remains useful, but only protects
Jump/Glide property writes. It no longer gates Movement Speed, Action Recovery,
Damage or the local-player pointer.

This is intentionally simpler than the rejected V0.17 structural identity
module and the intermediate V0.17B combined filter.


## V0.18 Skip Logos - single-path test

Scope is intentionally limited to Skip Logos.

External verification confirms the two company startup movies are loose files:

```text
ProjectMayhem/Content/Movies/THQ_LogoBasic.mp4
ProjectMayhem/Content/Movies/AS_LogoBasic.mp4
```

The rejected V0.15 paths stay rejected:

```text
late CreateFile/GetFileAttributes hooks
PEB command-line -nostartupmovies injection
literal nostartupmovies query patch
```

V0.18 uses one new primitive only:

```text
dxgi.dll DllMain, before game entry
    -> patch the main EXE import table
    -> CreateFileW
    -> GetFileAttributesW
    -> GetFileAttributesExW
    -> return FILE_NOT_FOUND only for the two exact logo basenames
```

No game file is renamed, deleted or edited.

No story/cutscene movie is targeted. In particular
`CG_Intro_LowVi.mp4` is intentionally untouched.

This test is forced ON at boot because the hook must exist before UE4 startup.
Runtime configuration will only be added after the primitive is validated.

The ASI log reports both the early hook status and how many matching file
requests were blocked.


## V0.18B - Skip Logos / Skip Intro separation

The menu and configuration now reflect the actual startup order:

```text
Skip Logos
    -> company logos before the intro cinematic
    -> boot-only
    -> applies on next launch

Skip Intro Videos
    -> native g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot path
    -> intro cinematic only
```

They are separate options and both default to ON:

```ini
SkipLogos=1
SkipIntroVideos=1
```

Skip Logos is displayed directly above Skip Intro Videos in the System section.

The DXGI proxy reads the same `[Features] SkipLogos` INI value before UE4
startup. The overlay writes that same value, so there is one source of truth.
The menu also shows the actual boot state and blocked-file count.

V0.18's early-IAT primitive remains under test. The previous test produced no
visible skip, so V0.18B does not claim it is validated. No alternate fallback is
stacked into this build.


## V0.18C - Skip Logos Media Foundation test

Runtime evidence from V0.18B:

```text
Skip Logos boot=ON
EARLY_IAT CreateFileW=1
GetFileAttributesW=1
GetFileAttributesExW=1
blocked=0
```

Conclusion: the two startup movies do not travel through those main-EXE Win32
IAT calls. V0.18/V0.18B early-IAT interception is rejected.

V0.18C removes `EarlySkipLogos` from `dxgi.dll` completely. The DXGI proxy is
restored to the validated minimal loader.

Skip Logos now owns one primitive only:

```text
ASI startup on exact target
    -> hook mfplat!MFCreateSourceResolver
    -> capture IMFSourceResolver instance
    -> hook CreateObjectFromURL
    -> block only:
       THQ_LogoBasic.mp4
       AS_LogoBasic.mp4
```

The hook is installed from the ASI after normal DLL loading, never from
`DllMain`.

Diagnostics are bounded to the first eight Media Foundation URLs. The menu
shows:

```text
MF READY/OFF
resolver READY/waiting
URL call count
blocked count
```

`SkipLogos=1` and `SkipIntroVideos=1` remain independent and ON by default.
Skip Intro continues to use only the validated native
`g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot` CVar.


## V0.18D - UE4 StartupMovies Skip Logos

V0.18C Media Foundation is rejected after in-game testing: both company logos
remain visible.

The new path is deliberately simpler and targets the UE4 startup-movie
configuration itself.

Darksiders Genesis stores user configuration under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\THQ Nordic\Darksiders Genesis\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\
```

V0.18D manages a small marked block in `Game.ini`:

```ini
; BEGIN DarksidersGenesisEnhanced SkipLogos
[/Script/MoviePlayer.MoviePlayerSettings]
-StartupMovies=THQ_LogoBasic
-StartupMovies=AS_LogoBasic
; END DarksidersGenesisEnhanced SkipLogos
```

This removes only the two company startup movies from UE4's
`MoviePlayerSettings.StartupMovies` array. It does not touch the intro
cinematic or any game files.

`Skip Logos` remains directly above `Skip Intro Videos` in the menu.

Both default ON. V0.18D introduces config revision `1804`; upgrading from any
older test INI resets these two options to ON exactly once:

```ini
SkipLogos=1
SkipIntroVideos=1
```

After that migration, user choices persist normally.

Skip Logos changes require a game restart because UE4 reads StartupMovies during
boot. Skip Intro remains the independent validated native
`g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot` control.
