# Darksiders Genesis Enhanced PC Mod

Modern runtime enhancements for **Darksiders Genesis (PC)** using a local x64
DXGI proxy and ASI plugin.

The project is deliberately fail-open for normal runtime failures and
**fail-closed for unsupported game executables**.

## Current development state

- Latest published binary release: **V0.29**
- Safety hotfix **V0.31** and lazy overlay **V0.32** retained
- Latest failed cursor experiment: **V0.33**
- Earlier V0.34 F5 reticle focus workaround is **not reliable**; reticle bug remains open
- Current status: **V0.38 loads successfully**; earlier V0.38 startup failure was a Windows Defender quarantine false alarm. V0.39 remains an optional loader-diagnostic build, not a required repair. V0.38 yaw and Alt-Tab changes still need separate in-game validation.
- Target executable:

```text
DarksidersGenesis-Win64-Shipping.exe
Size: 62,113,280 bytes
SHA-256: 9f4702024df5eea1d51df7745b0ad1ea95b97009982f73ddc1218c53dff33d54
```

V0.17 calculates the executable SHA-256 at runtime. If the executable does not
match exactly, the overlay/log can still load but **gameplay hooks are not
installed**.


## Development and versioning policy

Development now advances directly on `main`: one new numbered build per
version (V0.35, V0.36, V0.37...), recorded by normal Git commits. Do not
create a new `dev/v...` branch for every build. A published release is only
created after in-game validation; the latest release V0.29 stays unchanged
until a newer version is approved. Work-in-progress commits on `main` are
not release candidates.

Historic `dev/` branches are legacy experiments. Do not delete them until
their divergent Git history is confirmed reachable from a durable reference.

## Installation

Copy these files next to the game executable:

```text
dxgi.dll
DarksidersGenesisMod.asi
DarksidersGenesisMod.ini
```

Launch the game normally.

Default overlay key:

```text
Insert
```

The menu key and F1-F12 actions can be remapped from the overlay.

## Feature status

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| D3D11 / ImGui overlay | Stable |
| Rebindable menu key | Stable |
| Toggle HUD | Validated |
| Movement Speed | Validated; V0.17B restores the proven V0.14F local-pawn + Jump/Glide identity path |
| Action Recovery | Validated V0.8B tail-only policy |
| Jump Height | Validated |
| Glide / Flight Duration | Validated |
| Skip Intro | Validated |
| Hotstreak Charge | Validated |
| Pistol Damage | Functional heuristic: `BaseJuice > 0` |
| Melee Damage | Experimental heuristic: zero-juice outgoing records |
| Horse Speed | Validated V0.29 native movement offset correction; lifetime-safe V0.31 |
| Horse Sprint Duration | **Validated V0.27** - native HorseCharacter stamina drain; 0x vanilla, 5x default, 20x max |
| Horse Sprint Speed | Validated V0.29 native SprintingMaxSpeed; lifetime-safe V0.31 |
| Manual Reticle Focus Refresh | **Unreliable/experimental** - F5 focus pulse may help, but does not fix persistent cross-shaped reticle |
| FOV | Not implemented |
| Third Person camera | Not implemented |
| Skip Logos | **Validated V0.19C/V0.19D** - proprietary `StartupScreens` MoviePlayer attachment bypass |

Unimplemented controls are disabled in the V0.17 overlay/default configuration
instead of pretending to be active.

## Default hotkeys

```text
F1  Toggle HUD
F2  Movement Speed
F3  Action Recovery
F4  Skip Intro Videos
F5  Reticle Focus Test (V0.34 validated manual fix)
F6-F12  None
```

## V0.17 core architecture

The cleanup branch separates the runtime into explicit modules:

```text
dxgi_proxy.cpp
    local DXGI forwarding + ASI loading

DarksidersGenesisMod.cpp
    active hook orchestration + D3D11 renderer integration

ConfigStore.cpp
    INI + hotkeys + debounced persistence

RuntimeSettings.cpp
    atomic gameplay settings consumed by hook threads

TargetValidator.cpp
    exact executable size/SHA-256 gate

OverlayUi.cpp
    ImGui menu only, using an explicit context

HorseFeature.cpp
    isolated horse candidate logic
```

Historical/rejected hook families are no longer compiled into the runtime core.

## Horse reference

The authoritative horse research source is the user-supplied working reference
mod:

```text
ZZZ-Horse_P.pak
SHA-256: 3719ac840e1d0d7f137c9322580a3abe58cc5cf93d4b1ea97352c66490d3a920
```

Proven vanilla -> modified values include:

```text
MaxWalkSpeed                       1300 -> 1500
MaxAcceleration                     600 -> 700
BrakingFrictionFactor                 1 -> 2
GallopSpawnSpeedThreshold            300 -> 400

StaminaRecoveryPercentageRate         15 -> 100
StaminaTotalRecoveryPercentageRate    40 -> 100
StaminaSprintPercentageRate           25 -> 0
```

See `docs/REFERENCE_PAK_AUDIT.md` for the complete reference audit.

## Configuration behavior

Gameplay hook threads do not read the editable UI config directly.

V0.17 publishes settings into atomic runtime values immediately. INI persistence
is debounced, so dragging a slider no longer rewrites the entire file every
render frame.

The explicit **Save** button still persists immediately.

## Documentation

- `docs/FULL_AUDIT_V0.16A.md` - audit that triggered the V0.17 cleanup
- `docs/CORE_CLEANUP_V0.17.md` - V0.17 implementation / verification report
- `docs/REFERENCE_PAK_AUDIT.md` - supplied reference mod findings
- `docs/DODGE_RECOVERY_AUDIT.md` - recovery investigation
- `docs/TECHNICAL_NOTEBOOK.md` - complete historical development notebook

## Build

The project uses CMake and GitHub Actions.

MinHook and Dear ImGui are pinned to exact upstream commits for reproducible
builds.

The test artifact remains a flat package containing:

```text
dxgi.dll
DarksidersGenesisMod.asi
DarksidersGenesisMod.ini
README.md
```

## Release policy

Experimental branches are preserved as technical history.

`main` is not advanced merely because a candidate compiles. Gameplay changes
must be validated in game before promotion.


## V0.17B player-identity rollback fix

The first V0.17 cleanup introduced a new structural identity heuristic using
MaxWalkSpeed / MaxAcceleration. Runtime testing proved that heuristic rejected
the real player and therefore blocked Movement Speed, Jump, Glide and all
features depending on the captured local-player pointer.

V0.17B removes that unvalidated module completely and restores the path already
proven in V0.14F:

```text
APawn::IsLocallyControlled
  + valid JumpZ
  + valid DoubleJumpZ
  + valid GlideDuration
  = local player movement component
```

Only after that proven movement signature succeeds is
`g_localPlayerCharacter` updated.

The V0.17 cleanup work for target validation, atomic runtime settings,
ConfigStore, OverlayUi, debounced INI persistence, shutdown and dead-code
removal is retained.


## Working rule / fil rouge

From this point forward the project follows a deliberately simple rule:

1. Keep validated behavior unless a test proves it wrong.
2. Do not add a second heuristic when an already validated path exists.
3. A feature owns one clear primitive and one clear responsibility.
4. Diagnostics must be bounded and must not become fallback trees.
5. Rejected experiments are removed from runtime code and kept in Git/docs.
6. Change one gameplay subject at a time.
7. The cumulative README records every accepted direction change and rejection.

### V0.17B final player rollback policy

Player identity is restored exactly to the previously validated V0.14F rule:

```text
APawn::IsLocallyControlled(characterOwner)
    -> g_localPlayerCharacter = characterOwner
```

JumpZ / DoubleJumpZ / GlideDuration validation remains useful, but only protects
Jump/Glide property writes. It no longer gates Movement Speed, Action Recovery,
Damage or the local-player pointer.

This is intentionally simpler than the rejected V0.17 structural identity
module and the intermediate V0.17B combined filter.


## V0.18 Skip Logos - single-path test

Scope is intentionally limited to Skip Logos.

External verification confirms the two company startup movies are loose files:

```text
ProjectMayhem/Content/Movies/THQ_LogoBasic.mp4
ProjectMayhem/Content/Movies/AS_LogoBasic.mp4
```

The rejected V0.15 paths stay rejected:

```text
late CreateFile/GetFileAttributes hooks
PEB command-line -nostartupmovies injection
literal nostartupmovies query patch
```

V0.18 uses one new primitive only:

```text
dxgi.dll DllMain, before game entry
    -> patch the main EXE import table
    -> CreateFileW
    -> GetFileAttributesW
    -> GetFileAttributesExW
    -> return FILE_NOT_FOUND only for the two exact logo basenames
```

No game file is renamed, deleted or edited.

No story/cutscene movie is targeted. In particular
`CG_Intro_LowVi.mp4` is intentionally untouched.

This test is forced ON at boot because the hook must exist before UE4 startup.
Runtime configuration will only be added after the primitive is validated.

The ASI log reports both the early hook status and how many matching file
requests were blocked.


## V0.18B - Skip Logos / Skip Intro separation

The menu and configuration now reflect the actual startup order:

```text
Skip Logos
    -> company logos before the intro cinematic
    -> boot-only
    -> applies on next launch

Skip Intro Videos
    -> native g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot path
    -> intro cinematic only
```

They are separate options and both default to ON:

```ini
SkipLogos=1
SkipIntroVideos=1
```

Skip Logos is displayed directly above Skip Intro Videos in the System section.

The DXGI proxy reads the same `[Features] SkipLogos` INI value before UE4
startup. The overlay writes that same value, so there is one source of truth.
The menu also shows the actual boot state and blocked-file count.

V0.18's early-IAT primitive remains under test. The previous test produced no
visible skip, so V0.18B does not claim it is validated. No alternate fallback is
stacked into this build.


## V0.18C - Skip Logos Media Foundation test

Runtime evidence from V0.18B:

```text
Skip Logos boot=ON
EARLY_IAT CreateFileW=1
GetFileAttributesW=1
GetFileAttributesExW=1
blocked=0
```

Conclusion: the two startup movies do not travel through those main-EXE Win32
IAT calls. V0.18/V0.18B early-IAT interception is rejected.

V0.18C removes `EarlySkipLogos` from `dxgi.dll` completely. The DXGI proxy is
restored to the validated minimal loader.

Skip Logos now owns one primitive only:

```text
ASI startup on exact target
    -> hook mfplat!MFCreateSourceResolver
    -> capture IMFSourceResolver instance
    -> hook CreateObjectFromURL
    -> block only:
       THQ_LogoBasic.mp4
       AS_LogoBasic.mp4
```

The hook is installed from the ASI after normal DLL loading, never from
`DllMain`.

Diagnostics are bounded to the first eight Media Foundation URLs. The menu
shows:

```text
MF READY/OFF
resolver READY/waiting
URL call count
blocked count
```

`SkipLogos=1` and `SkipIntroVideos=1` remain independent and ON by default.
Skip Intro continues to use only the validated native
`g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot` CVar.


## V0.18D - UE4 StartupMovies Skip Logos

V0.18C Media Foundation is rejected after in-game testing: both company logos
remain visible.

The new path is deliberately simpler and targets the UE4 startup-movie
configuration itself.

Darksiders Genesis stores user configuration under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\THQ Nordic\Darksiders Genesis\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\
```

V0.18D manages a small marked block in `Game.ini`:

```ini
; BEGIN DarksidersGenesisEnhanced SkipLogos
[/Script/MoviePlayer.MoviePlayerSettings]
-StartupMovies=THQ_LogoBasic
-StartupMovies=AS_LogoBasic
; END DarksidersGenesisEnhanced SkipLogos
```

This removes only the two company startup movies from UE4's
`MoviePlayerSettings.StartupMovies` array. It does not touch the intro
cinematic or any game files.

`Skip Logos` remains directly above `Skip Intro Videos` in the menu.

Both default ON. V0.18D introduces config revision `1804`; upgrading from any
older test INI resets these two options to ON exactly once:

```ini
SkipLogos=1
SkipIntroVideos=1
```

After that migration, user choices persist normally.

Skip Logos changes require a game restart because UE4 reads StartupMovies during
boot. Skip Intro remains the independent validated native
`g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot` control.


## V0.18E - Early global file-block test

V0.18D UE4 `Game.ini` StartupMovies override is rejected after in-game testing:
the override is written successfully but both company logos are still displayed.

V0.18E returns to the original file-block idea, but moves it earlier and makes
it process-wide.

Single path:

```text
first DXGI factory call
    -> outside DllMain
    -> before ASI loading
    -> MinHook KernelBase!CreateFileW
    -> exact basenames only:
       THQ_LogoBasic.mp4
       AS_LogoBasic.mp4
    -> ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
```

This differs from V0.18/V0.18B:

- no main-EXE IAT patch;
- no Game.ini override;
- no Media Foundation hook;
- no extra fallback tree.

Because the hook targets the actual Win32 function rather than one module's IAT,
calls from any loaded game/UE4 module pass through the same detour.

The proxy records:

```text
CreateFileW total calls
.mp4 calls
blocked target calls
```

The overlay exposes those counters beside Skip Logos.

`SkipLogos=1` and `SkipIntroVideos=1` remain independent and ON by default.
Config revision `1805` resets those two values to ON exactly once when upgrading
from an older test build.

Skip Intro remains exclusively on the validated native
`g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot` path.


## V0.18F - native SetupLoadingScreenFromIni bypass

V0.18E proved that a process-wide `CreateFileW` hook was installed and active,
but no MP4 open ever passed through it. That file-open route is rejected.

A direct executable audit identified the actual UE4 startup-movie path.

Exact retail target:

```text
DarksidersGenesis-Win64-Shipping.exe
size       62,113,280 bytes
SHA-256    9f4702024df5eea1d51df7745b0ad1ea95b97009982f73ddc1218c53dff33d54
SizeOfImage 0x03DDF000
```

Engine initialization contains the marker:

```text
GetMoviePlayer()->SetupLoadingScreenFromIni
```

The caller resolves `GetMoviePlayer()`, reads its vtable and invokes slot
`+0x78`. The corresponding vtable entry points exactly to:

```text
FDefaultGameMoviePlayer::SetupLoadingScreenFromIni
RVA 0x0160BC50
VA  0x14160BC50
```

That function reads, in order:

```text
bWaitForMoviesToComplete
bMoviesAreSkippable
StartupMovies
```

V0.18F therefore owns one primitive only:

```text
first DXGI factory call
    -> outside DllMain
    -> before ASI startup
    -> validate retail SizeOfImage + exact native prologue
    -> MinHook RVA 0x160BC50
    -> Skip Logos ON: return immediately
    -> Skip Logos OFF: call original function
```

No file hook, no Media Foundation hook, no Game.ini override and no fallback
tree remain in the active Skip Logos path.

Overlay telemetry:

```text
NATIVE READY/OFF
target VALID/INVALID
calls
skipped
```

Skip Intro stays entirely separate on the already validated native
`g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot` control.

Config revision `1806` resets `SkipLogos` and `SkipIntroVideos` to ON once
when upgrading from an older test build.


## V0.18G - earliest native MoviePlayer RET patch

V0.18F proved that the audited MoviePlayer target was valid and the MinHook
detour installed successfully, but runtime telemetry stayed:

```text
setupCalls=0
skipped=0
```

Therefore the one startup call to `SetupLoadingScreenFromIni` occurs before the
first DXGI factory call where V0.18F installed its hook.

Executable audit confirms `dxgi.dll` is a normal import, not a delay import.
Its `DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)` therefore executes before the game entry
point.

V0.18G removes MinHook from the DXGI proxy entirely and uses a one-byte
fail-closed patch:

```text
DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH
    -> validate PE64
    -> SizeOfImage == 0x03DDF000
    -> validate exact prologue at RVA 0x0160BC50
    -> Skip Logos ON:
       0x48 -> 0xC3
       SetupLoadingScreenFromIni returns immediately
    -> Skip Logos OFF:
       restore native 0x48
```

No thread, no media hook, no file hook, no Game.ini override and no fallback
tree are used.

The ASI only exposes runtime control and telemetry:

```text
EARLY PATCHED/NATIVE
target VALID/INVALID
```

Skip Intro remains entirely separate on the validated native
`g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot` path.

Config revision `1807` resets `SkipLogos` and `SkipIntroVideos` to ON once
when upgrading from an older test build.


### V0.18G in-game verdict: REJECTED

Latest runtime test:

```text
Target validation: exact=1
Skip Logos EARLY: proxy=1 target=1 patched=1 enabled=1 RVA=0x160BC50
```

Despite the exact retail target being validated and the one-byte RET patch being
successfully applied before normal game startup, the THQ Nordic / Airship
Syndicate startup logos are still displayed.

Conclusion:

- the patch timing is early enough;
- RVA `0x160BC50` is a real and valid MoviePlayer function;
- bypassing `SetupLoadingScreenFromIni` does **not** control these two observed
  company logos in this build;
- V0.18G is rejected and must not be promoted to `main`;
- do not revisit the V0.18G RET path without new executable evidence.

The validated gameplay core remains unchanged. Skip Intro continues to work
independently through `g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot`.

Next Skip Logos work must begin from fresh native analysis of the actual company
logo playback path rather than another timing variation of the rejected
`SetupLoadingScreenFromIni` route.


## V0.18H - CustomSplashScreen branch bypass

V0.18G proved that the MoviePlayer `SetupLoadingScreenFromIni` path was not the
source of the visible THQ Nordic / Airship Syndicate logos: the exact target was
validated and patched before game startup, yet both logos still appeared.

A deeper audit of the surrounding `FEngineLoop::PreInitPostStartupScreen`
control flow identified the second startup-screen path:

```text
GetMoviePlayer()->HasEarlyStartupMovie()
    YES -> Initialize -> PlayEarlyStartupMovies()
    NO  -> FPreLoadScreenManager
           -> HasRegisteredPreLoadScreenType(CustomSplashScreen)
           -> PlayFirstPreLoadScreen(CustomSplashScreen)
```

The executable's `EarlyStartupMovie` block matches the Unreal startup flow:
when no early MoviePlayer startup movie owns the screen, the engine falls back
to a registered `CustomSplashScreen`.

Exact retail call-site:

```text
RVA 0x002535DE  test al, al
RVA 0x002535E0  74 0F     je skip_custom_splash
...
RVA 0x002535EB  call FPreLoadScreenManager::PlayFirstPreLoadScreen
```

V0.18H owns one primitive only:

```text
dxgi.dll DllMain
    -> validate PE64 + SizeOfImage 0x03DDF000
    -> validate exact surrounding bytes
    -> Skip Logos ON:
       RVA 0x2535E0  74 -> EB
       always skip PlayFirstPreLoadScreen(CustomSplashScreen)
    -> Skip Logos OFF:
       restore 74
```

No MoviePlayer setup patch, file hook, media hook, Game.ini override, MinHook,
thread or fallback tree is active for Skip Logos.

This follows the lesson from the validated POSTAL startup-logo fix: target the
actual early startup-screen state/control path rather than the eventual media
file open.

Skip Intro remains fully independent on the validated native
`g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot` path.

Config revision `1808` resets `SkipLogos` and `SkipIntroVideos` to ON once
when upgrading from older test builds.


## V0.18I - EarlyStartupMovie / CustomSplashScreen selector bypass

The supplied runtime log was from **V0.18G**, not V0.18H:

```text
Darksiders Genesis Enhanced ASI 0.18G-dllmain-native-ret-test
Skip Logos EARLY: proxy=1 target=1 patched=1 enabled=1 RVA=0x160BC50
```

That confirms the already documented V0.18G failure, but it does not constitute
an in-game test of V0.18H.

A fresh audit of the exact supported retail executable:

```text
DarksidersGenesis-Win64-Shipping.exe
size       62,113,280 bytes
SHA-256    9f4702024df5eea1d51df7745b0ad1ea95b97009982f73ddc1218c53dff33d54
```

shows the complete early startup-screen selector in
`FEngineLoop::PreInitPostStartupScreen`.

Relevant control flow:

```text
RVA 0x253546  call GetMoviePlayer
...
RVA 0x253551  call [vtable+0x30]
RVA 0x253554  test al,al
RVA 0x253556  je 0x2535A8

TRUE branch:
RVA 0x253558  "EarlyStartupMovie"
...
RVA 0x25359B  call [vtable+0x38]

FALSE branch:
RVA 0x2535A8  "PlayFirstPreLoadScreen"
...
RVA 0x2535EB  call FPreLoadScreenManager::PlayFirstPreLoadScreen

common resume:
RVA 0x2535FD
```

This proves why V0.18H was incomplete: its patch at `0x2535E0` affected only
the `CustomSplashScreen` fallback. When an EarlyStartupMovie exists, execution
takes the TRUE branch and never reaches the patched H branch.

V0.18H is therefore **superseded by native analysis before validation**. It is
not promoted and does not need another in-game test.

V0.18I owns one primitive only:

```text
dxgi.dll DllMain
    -> validate PE64 + SizeOfImage 0x03DDF000
    -> validate exact startup-selector bytes
    -> Skip Logos ON:
       RVA 0x253546
       E8 45 56 3B 01
       ->
       E9 B2 00 00 00

       jump directly to RVA 0x2535FD
       bypass both:
         EarlyStartupMovie
         CustomSplashScreen

    -> Skip Logos OFF:
       restore E8 45 56 3B 01
```

This does **not** patch `SetupLoadingScreenFromIni`, does not hook file I/O,
does not hook Media Foundation, and does not modify `Game.ini`.

Normal game cutscenes remain outside this selector. The separately validated
Skip Intro feature remains exclusively controlled by:

```text
g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot
```

Config revision `1809` resets `SkipLogos` and `SkipIntroVideos` to ON once
when upgrading from older test builds.

V0.18I also removes two harmless duplicate `skipLogosEnabled` runtime
publications and replaces the obsolete overlay text `Game.ini write failed`
with the correct startup-patch diagnostic.


## V0.19A/B/C - proprietary StartupScreens audit and final Skip Logos fix

A direct audit of the supported retail executable identified the game-specific
startup screen plugin compiled into Darksiders Genesis:

```text
ProjectMayhem/Plugins/StartupScreens/Source/StartupScreens/Private/SStartupScreens.cpp
ProjectMayhem/Plugins/StartupScreens/Source/StartupScreens/Private/StartupScreensModule.cpp
```

The plugin exposes its own startup-screen configuration and playback path,
including:

```text
UStartupScreensSettings
StartupScreenDef
StartupMovies
TimeToShow
Image
PromptText
FadeTime
bMoviesAreSkippable
SStartupScreens
```

This explains why the previous generic UE4 MoviePlayer / StartupMovies
experiments did not control the visible THQ Nordic / Airship Syndicate logos.

Three independent plugin-level candidates were tested:

### V0.19A - StartupScreens module kill

```text
FStartupScreensModule::StartupModule
RVA 0x25FE40
-> immediate RET
```

**In-game verdict: REJECTED AS TOO BROAD.**

The logos disappear, but the intro cinematic is also skipped even with
`Skip Intro Videos=OFF`.

### V0.19B - empty StartupScreens movie playlist

```text
RVA 0x25FF31
44 8B 76 08
->
45 33 F6 90
```

This forces the copied `StartupMovies` count to zero before
`SStartupScreens` receives the playlist.

**In-game verdict: REJECTED AS TOO BROAD.**

The logos disappear, but the intro cinematic is still skipped when
`Skip Intro Videos=OFF`. The warning screen remains visible, proving this path
controls more than only the two company logo presentations.

### V0.19C - bypass StartupScreens MoviePlayer attachment

```text
RVA 0x260244
-> jump to RVA 0x260257
```

This keeps the proprietary `StartupScreens` module and object construction
intact, but skips only the block that attaches `SStartupScreens` to the engine
MoviePlayer.

**In-game verdict: VALIDATED.**

Observed behavior:

```text
Skip Logos ON
  -> THQ Nordic / Airship Syndicate logos skipped

Skip Intro Videos OFF
  -> warning screen remains
  -> intro cinematic still plays normally

Skip Intro Videos ON
  -> independent validated intro skip remains functional
```

A slightly longer black transition can occur when Skip Intro is OFF, but it is
minor and does not affect correctness or stability.

### V0.19D - cleanup / validated baseline

V0.19D is the clean continuation of V0.19C. It changes no gameplay behavior and
retains exactly the validated primitive:

```text
StartupScreens MoviePlayer attachment bypass
RVA 0x260244 -> 0x260257
```

No generic StartupMovies patch, no Media Foundation hook, no file hook, no
StartupModule kill, and no empty-playlist fallback remain in the active path.

The two user-facing options are now cleanly independent:

```text
Skip Logos
    -> proprietary StartupScreens attachment bypass

Skip Intro Videos
    -> g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot
```


## V0.27 / V0.28 - HorseCharacter detection and Sprint Duration validated

V0.27 finally resolves the horse at the correct layer by hooking native
`HorseCharacter` functions directly instead of inferring the mount from player
identity, Blueprint accessors or generic movement components.

Validated native capture paths include:

```text
HorseCharacter::GetNormalizedSpeed
HorseCharacter::GetNormalizedSpeedInput
HorseCharacter::TryStartSprinting
HorseCharacter::SetSprintingTrue
```

In-game validation captured a real horse instance with the expected native
stamina data:

```text
StaminaRecoveryPercentageRate      15
StaminaTotalRecoveryPercentageRate 40
StaminaRecoveryCooldown             2
StaminaSprintPercentageRate        25
CurrentStamina / MaxStamina        62 / 62
```

Horse Sprint Duration is therefore considered validated. The feature changes
the native sprint stamina drain rate rather than enlarging the stamina pool.

```text
0x   = vanilla drain / vanilla duration
5x   = default, approximately 5x sprint duration
20x  = maximum
```

V0.28 changes only the user-facing range/default for this validated feature:
default `5.00x`, maximum `20.00x`. The native HorseCharacter detection path
from V0.27 is retained unchanged.


## V0.29 - Horse Speed / Sprint Speed native movement correction

V0.29 keeps the validated V0.27 native `HorseCharacter` resolver and the
validated V0.28 sprint-duration path, but fixes the remaining horse speed
primitives.

The retail UE4 reflection table proves the exact movement fields:

```text
UMayhemHorseCharacterMovementComponent / UCharacterMovementComponent

MaxWalkSpeed            +0x1DC
MaxWalkSpeedCrouched    +0x1E0
MaxSwimSpeed            +0x1E4
MaxFlySpeed             +0x1E8
MaxCustomMovementSpeed  +0x1EC
MaxAcceleration         +0x1F0
MinAnalogWalkSpeed      +0x1F4
BrakingFrictionFactor   +0x1F8
BrakingFriction         +0x1FC

UMayhemHorseCharacterMovementComponent
SprintingMaxSpeed       +0x760
```

Previous horse candidates incorrectly wrote some of these neighboring fields.
V0.29 also removes the invalid `movement+0x190 == horse` acceptance test:
`HorseCharacter::GetNormalizedSpeed` already resolves the native movement
component through its own virtual getter at vtable slot `+0x5F8`.

Horse Speed now targets the real movement component's `MaxWalkSpeed` and
`MaxAcceleration`; Horse Sprint Speed targets that same movement component's
`SprintingMaxSpeed`.


## V0.30 - Graphics Adapter Engine.ini control

V0.30 adds a small system setting for selecting Unreal Engine's graphics
adapter index.

The overlay exposes values `0` through `4` with `0` as the default.
The selected value is persisted in `DarksidersGenesisMod.ini` and written to:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\THQ Nordic\Darksiders Genesis\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\Engine.ini
```

The mod writes exactly:

```ini
[SystemSettings]
r.GraphicsAdapter=N
```

If `[SystemSettings]` or `r.GraphicsAdapter` does not exist, it is created.
If the key already exists, only its value is updated through the Win32 INI API.
Other Engine.ini settings are preserved.

A game restart is required for adapter selection to affect device creation.


## V0.31 - Horse UObject lifetime safety hotfix

V0.29 validated the native horse speed, sprint-speed and stamina primitives, but
the first long level-load test exposed an important lifetime bug inherited by
V0.30.

The horse subsystem cached raw `HorseCharacter` and horse movement pointers and
re-applied tunings every rendered frame. During seamless travel or level reload,
UE4 can destroy those UObjects while the cached addresses remain readable and may
later be recycled for unrelated allocations. Continuing to write horse offsets
through such stale pointers can corrupt unrelated game state.

The reported failure presented as:
- a malformed/default-looking reticle after loading;
- corrupted HUD/menu visual elements;
- eventual `0xC0000005` write access violation inside the game's reference-
  counted object destruction path.

V0.31 changes the ownership rule:

```text
Native HorseCharacter callback active
    -> horse pointer is considered live
    -> resolve current horse movement
    -> apply Horse Speed / Sprint Speed / Sprint Duration

Outside a native HorseCharacter callback
    -> no horse-memory writes
```

Additional safety:
- `Tick()` performs no cached-pointer writes;
- the generic movement hook performs no horse writes;
- shutdown never restores values through cached raw UObject pointers;
- the horse movement pointer is re-resolved on every native horse capture;
- a changed movement pointer resets cached baselines as a new horse generation;
- generic movement exclusion accepts a cached horse movement only for a short
  window after a live native HorseCharacter callback.

The validated V0.30 Graphics Adapter Engine.ini control is retained unchanged.


## V0.32 - Reticle / Alt-Tab isolation

V0.31 removes the horse stale-pointer write path, but a separate visual issue
remains: immediately after loading a level the reticle can appear as a broken
cross, while a simple Alt-Tab restores the correct reticle.

The V0.31 session log proves the malformed reticle appears before the first
fully validated horse capture, so this visual issue is treated separately from
the horse lifetime crash.

V0.32 isolates the D3D11 overlay path:

- ImGui is no longer initialized on the first game Present;
- no overlay RTV is created during normal gameplay;
- the game window is not subclassed until the user opens the mod menu;
- the complete overlay backend is created lazily on the first menu-key press;
- game-window foreground transitions are logged;
- every process-owned DXGI ResizeBuffers call is logged before and after.

Test policy:

1. Start the game and do not open the mod overlay.
2. Load a save and inspect the reticle.
3. If the broken cross is present, Alt-Tab once.
4. Preserve the per-session log.

This determines whether the fix comes from DXGI ResizeBuffers, focus activation,
or merely avoiding early ImGui/RTV/WndProc initialization.


## V0.33 - Cursor-layer reticle fix

The V0.32 focus trace isolates the broken-cross issue from both the horse system
and the ImGui overlay:

- the malformed cross can appear before ImGui is initialized;
- Alt-Tab repairs it through a foreground transition;
- no DXGI `ResizeBuffers` occurs during the fixing Alt-Tab;
- the reticle/cross remains visible when `ui.HideHud` is forced, proving it is
  handled by the cursor layer rather than the ordinary HUD layer.

Retail executable audit identifies:

```text
UAirshipUIManager::IsCursorVisible
RVA 0x715800
```

The native function ultimately reads the PlayerController mouse-cursor visible
state.

V0.33 therefore:
- hooks `UAirshipUIManager::IsCursorVisible`;
- forces cursor visibility false while mod Hide HUD is active;
- schedules a cursor refresh when a newly validated player instance appears;
- posts `WM_SETCURSOR` to the real game window several times after load;
- logs the active `HCURSOR`, visibility and position around focus transitions
  and forced refreshes.

This is intended to reproduce the cursor-reset part of Alt-Tab without actually
changing application focus.


## V0.34 - Reticle focus-cycle workaround (validated manually in-game)

V0.33 is **rejected as an effective reticle fix**. Its scheduled WM_SETCURSOR
messages were successfully posted after a new player was found, but did not
repair the cross-shaped reticle. The user's V0.33 log also shows that a genuine
Alt-Tab involves a different OS cursor handle after focus comes back, and no
DXGI ResizeBuffers call was observed. The trace contained an F4 action but no
F1 Hide HUD toggle, so Hide HUD cursor suppression is not yet proven either way.

V0.34 removes automatic WM_SETCURSOR refreshes that did nothing. It introduces
one manually triggered reticle-repair action:

- `F5 = ReticleFocusTest` in the included INI;
- the action is also selectable from the remappable Hotkeys tab;
- the test does **not** Alt-Tab, steal foreground or move the mouse;
- it posts one paired simulated deactivate/activate message sequence to the
  game's window: `WM_ACTIVATEAPP`, `WM_ACTIVATE`, then `WM_SETFOCUS`
  and `WM_SETCURSOR`;
- logs each posting result and cursor handle, then captures cursor state
  500 ms afterward;
- no ongoing timer, native horse writes, or per-frame cursor replacement.

**In-game validation (2026-10-08):** The user confirms that V0.34's F5
focus-cycle action fixes the malformed reticle after loading. The confirmed
result is the **manual F5 workaround**, not an automatic fix on every load.
The separate V0.33 Hide HUD cursor visibility behavior has not yet received a
dedicated F1 test; do not describe it as validated.

**Usage:** With the malformed cross visible and the mod overlay CLOSED,
press F5 once. If using an older mod INI, set `F5=ReticleFocusTest` under
`[Hotkeys]` or remap a key to `Reticle Focus Test` in the overlay.
This action can temporarily change the game's perceived input focus; a real
Alt-Tab may restore the normal state if focus behaves unexpectedly.

**Safety:** V0.31 horse lifetime ownership rules remain untouched; V0.32 lazy
ImGui creation remains. The V0.29 binary release is kept as a rollback option.


## V0.35 - camera investigation restarted from V0.34

Source: validated V0.34 commit 32f7827cc2968596a34dadc6466730d4280ff94b.
None of the V0.35A/B/C or V0.36 camera changes are inherited.

The camera is NOT modified by this test build. Two individually validated
read-only native-method hooks record whether UCameraComponent::GetCameraView
(RVA 0x16F9790) and USpringArmComponent::UpdateDesiredArmLocation
(RVA 0x6F57B0) are exercised in actual gameplay. The hooks call the original
implementation unchanged. They only sample a live FOV output / current arm
distance and log the first 12 calls then one of every 5000. The correct
retail EXE hash and instruction prologues must match before installation.
No native UObject pointers survive callbacks; no camera setting or rotation
is changed. Existing FOV is OFF/locked, and no fake zoom setting is added.

Test on foot with War and Strife, then mounted if possible, while leaving
the mod overlay closed. Press F5 only if the reticle needs repairing.
Quit the game and provide the non-cumulative DarksidersGenesisMod.log.
Look for CameraTrace V0.35 READY and callback call counts.
Successful compilation does NOT prove that either native path controls
the rendered gameplay view. No promotion to main or public release until
an in-game test confirms behavior. Further zoom/FOV/angle work must use
verified live gameplay callbacks.


## V0.36 - independent Hide Reticle and visible camera controls (test)

This build continues directly on main, without creating a development branch.
Hide Reticle (default OFF; Hotkey F6 by default) is separate from Toggle HUD
(F1) and preserves F5's validated manual reticle focus repair. The existing
native UAirshipUIManager::IsCursorVisible hook now obeys Hide Reticle too.
A second, opt-in Windows SetCursor suppression path acts only when the game
is the foreground window, Hide Reticle is ON, and the mod overlay is closed.
This targets the malformed Windows cursor cross which may survive ui.HideHud.
The OS cursor is restored on exit from that suppression state. The in-game
behavior is NOT yet validated. The original reticle bug is not claimed fixed.

Camera is now a dedicated enabled tab, with FOV override (40 to 140,
default OFF/90), Zoom (+ closer / - farther, -75 to +200 percent, default 0),
and Camera Pitch Offset (-35 to +35 degrees, default 0). All settings are
persisted to the INI and published to atomics. Native, verified-method hooks
modify only a live FMinimalViewInfo output (FOV and pitch) and temporarily
scale the live SpringArm TargetArmLength in its own callback, restoring that
UObject field immediately afterward. No camera UObject pointer is cached
across frames. Hook readiness, callback counters and observed native/applied
values are shown in Camera and logged once per session with sampling.

Caveat: native GetCameraView and UpdateDesiredArmLocation are known code
addresses but their use by the actual gameplay camera remains unproven.
This is an EXPERIMENTAL candidate, not a claim that FOV/zoom/pitch work.
If no calls are observed, the next step is to locate the actual camera path
from the game's native call graph. Test normal gameplay, Strife, and mounted
camera if possible, and supply DarksidersGenesisMod.log.

Defaults remain vanilla for Hide Reticle, FOV, Zoom and Pitch. The config
revision does not change, to avoid resetting existing player preferences.
Older INI files read the new settings using safe defaults when missing.
The validated horse lifetime ownership, lazy ImGui overlay, skip logos and
F5 reticle recovery remain unchanged. Artifacts contain files at the ZIP root.

## V0.37 - Camera height + configurable arrow keys (TEST, 2026-10-08)

Based directly on the working V0.36 main commit 634f89dc.
**User in-game status:** FOV, Zoom and Camera Pitch are working.
A camera-height setting is now provided: CameraHeightOffset from -1500 to
+1500 world units, default zero (vanilla). It changes only the transient
FMinimalViewInfo.Location.Z output at +0x08 in the existing live camera
callback. It does not cache or write camera UObjects.

New camera keybinding actions are configured under [CameraHotkeys] and can
be rebound in the Camera tab. Defaults:
- Up: raise camera by 50 units; Down: lower camera by 50
- Left: Zoom Out by 10 percent; Right: Zoom In by 10 percent
- PitchDown, PitchUp: unbound; optional increments of 5 degrees

Keys repeat when held (initial delay 290 ms, repeat every 90 ms), only
while the game is foreground and mod overlay is closed. Duplicate bindings
are unbound in other camera actions. Capturing Escape cancels; menu key and
F1-F12 are reserved. Assigning None from the Camera UI is supported.
Existing INIs without [CameraHotkeys] use those defaults. Camera values and
hotkeys are saved via the normal debounce/persistence mechanism.

**Known Zoom issue (deferred):** Zoom changes camera arm distance without
updating UE4 depth-of-field focal distance or blur/postprocess parameters,
so a zoomed image can become very blurry. Do NOT regress the working zoom
just to compensate; native DOF correction is a separate future task.

**Reticle status corrected:** earlier V0.34 F5 focus pulse was prematurely
described as a validated repair. The user confirms the cross-shaped reticle
still occurs in V0.36. Thus F5 and the V0.36 Hide Reticle mechanism are
experimental, not a reliable bug fix; neither is promoted as solved.

One build number per iteration; changes committed on main; legacy stable
release v0.29 remains untouched. Per-launch non-cumulative log retained.
Test V0.37 in gameplay before promoting features to release.

## V0.38 - horizontal camera yaw, reticle UI and Alt-Tab mitigation (TEST)

Base: main V0.37 commit 1108b307a71886a17be6187fba0a4b8a690b04a8.
User log V0.36: Window focus trace switches foreground 1 to 0 around
23:17:10, with no observed return before logging stops; not proof
the mod caused lost focus. V0.37 log: Hide Reticle ON checked in menu,
but OS pointer suppression begins only on overlay close. F6 on/off
and Win32 SetCursor interceptions are proven by log.

V0.38:
- Native FMinimalViewInfo::Rotation.Yaw (+0x10) adjusted in transient
  GetCameraView output only; CameraYawDegrees -180..+180, default 0,
  configured with a live slider, number entry, default button.
- Bindable action YawLeft and YawRight, default NumPad 4 and NumPad 6
  with Num Lock enabled, 5 degrees per step. Prior bindings preserved.
- Hide Reticle menu explains gameplay-only behavior and includes
  Apply Reticle Setting and Return to Game to close the overlay.
  F6 remains the toggle; this does not repair the underlying malformed cross.
- Focus mitigation: restore cursor even when losing foreground
  (V0.37 erroneously only restored when foreground); release pointer
  clip on that suppression exit, do not block WM_ACTIVATEAPP,
  WM_ACTIVATE, WM_SETFOCUS, WM_KILLFOCUS, WM_MOUSEACTIVATE or Alt
  system key messages, and log WndProc focus messages.
  Only release cursor clipping from an active overlay while the game
  has foreground. In-game Alt-Tab still requires validation.
- No changes to validated FOV, Zoom, Pitch, Height or horse protections.
  Zoom postprocess Depth of Field blur is a tracked future task.
- No release until user in-game confirmation, sequential build
  V0.38 on main, artifacts ZIP root, session-only logs.

Validation: test yaw +/-30 degrees, NumPad4/6, custom bindings,
Hide Reticle checkbox and apply button, F6 with overlay closed,
Alt-Tab with overlay both open and closed and Hide Reticle both states.

## V0.39 - Startup loader diagnostic (TEST)

The user reported that the *direct-download* V0.38 did not show either
the overlay or any hooks. V0.36 and V0.37 previously loaded and functioned
on the same PC. The existing uploaded logs predate this V0.38 failure.
Static inspection of the V0.37/V0.38 Windows build artifacts found both
ZIPs valid with all four root-level files, same x64 PE architecture and
matching imported DLL families. No confirmed root cause yet.

V0.39 changes ONLY startup observability (not the camera or gameplay):
- The DXGI proxy writes DarksidersGenesisLoader.log into the same folder
  as dxgi.dll; this log is independent of DarksidersGenesisMod.asi.
- The first loader log truncates the previous session. It lists the
  proxy DLL path, ASI scan, each ASI LoadLibrary result and GetLastError,
  and the real System32 dxgi.dll load result. No cached pointers, no
  new hooks, and no changes to camera, reticle, horse or HUD behavior.
- Core startup version string updated to V0.39 so an old/cached ASI is
  immediately recognizable in DarksidersGenesisMod.log.
- A missing loader log means the game did not invoke the proxy's
  DXGI factory export, the proxy was not placed/loaded correctly, or
  initialization happened earlier than logging. In that case, confirm
  dxgi.dll is next to the actual DarksidersGenesis-Win64-Shipping.exe.
- If loader log exists but ASI log does not, look for the precise
  LoadLibrary result/error; also check game EXE hash and quarantine.
- If both log files exist with version 0.39, check native hook readiness.
- Treat V0.37 as verified fallback, not V0.38. No stable release.

The other unresolved issues remain: unreliable malformed reticle/F5,
potential Alt-Tab focus recovery, zoom-induced DOF blur, and in-game
validation of horizontal yaw. V0.39 makes no claims to fix these.

## 2026-10-09 correction: V0.38 startup failure was antivirus quarantine

The user confirmed that V0.38 **does load and work**. The preceding
"no overlay / no hooks" report was caused by Windows Defender flagging
and quarantining the mod, **not** by a confirmed loader or code defect.
This correction supersedes the original startup-failure hypothesis
documented in the V0.39 diagnostic entry above. Keep that historical
entry for traceability, but do not treat it as a current failure.

V0.38 is reinstated as a functioning test build. This does NOT by itself
validate every V0.38 feature (yaw camera rotation, Alt-Tab recovery, or
persistent reticle fix); these retain their separate test statuses.
V0.39 remains an optional loader diagnostic, not a mandatory patch.

Installation guidance: check Microsoft Defender Protection History if
the ASI or DLL disappears. Verify the downloaded file comes from the
project's GitHub repository before deciding how to handle a warning;
do not advise disabling antivirus globally or bulk-excluding folders.

## V0.40 - Diagnose cross-shaped reticle source after save load (TEST)

V0.38 user test confirms Hide Reticle ON/OFF fixed, while cursor still
looks like a cross immediately after loading a save. Log shows native
UAirshipUIManager::IsCursorVisible changing 0->1 after loading.
F5 synthetic focus pulse is unreliable and not a permanent fix.

V0.40 provides a reversible test mode separate from validated HideReticle:
[Features] CrossCursorTestMode=0 (default) = unmodified behavior.
1 = suppress only the Win32 SetCursor output while leaving native Unreal
cursor visibility untouched.
2 = suppress only the native Unreal cursor while leaving Win32 cursor
output untouched. Existing Hide Reticle independently hides both layers.
The ImGui overlay keeps its clickable mouse pointer. The user's menu
can apply changes and return to gameplay. Settings survive restart.
No additional game hooks and no cached UObject writes.

The SetCursor hook now logs changed requested OS cursor handles with a
bounded budget even if HideReticle is OFF. Native UI cursor visibility
transitions are also logged on state changes. This evidence distinguishes
the source of the cross from the legitimate reticle.

TEST: after loading the same save and reproducing cross, keep Hide Reticle
OFF. Try cross mode 1, then mode 2, returning to game each time. Tell
whether the cross disappears and whether normal reticle remains visible.
Restore 0 for default. This build is a diagnostic/possible mitigation,
not an already validated automatic reticle repair.

V0.38 functionality and camera, horse, focus, F6 kept unchanged;
V0.39 loader diagnostics retained. Build V0.40 from main, no dev
branches or automatic public release; permanent download ZIP on GitHub
since temporary artifact links have failed for this user. Log is
noncumulative per launch.

## V0.41 - Auto F5 reticle correction after save loading (test)

Actual V0.40 log: the test mode stayed CrossCursorTestMode=0, so the two
separate source-filter modes 1/2 were not exercised; do not consider
those experiments disproven. The game's normal load shows native UI
cursor visibility 0->1 after scene load. User's V0.38 test establishes
that pressing F5 or actual Alt-Tab fixes the cross; Hide Reticle ON/OFF
also works and must remain independent.

New [Features] AutoReticleRefreshOnLoad=1 defaults ON, with a gameplay
overlay checkbox. On a native UI cursor 0->1 load transition, arm a
2500ms delayed, one-shot replay of the existing F5 activate/deactivate
state machine. Run only on game Present with a validated local player,
foreground nonminimized window and closed overlay. No synthetic mouse,
SetForegroundWindow, UObject writes, cached game pointers or new hooks.
Only one automatic cycle per 20s, cancel pending on manual F5 or real
Alt-Tab, expire after 30s if gameplay is not ready. Log all arms,
dispatches and cancellations. Disable via INI if focus changes undesirably.

This is a candidate automatic workaround, not a validated fix until
user tests in game. V0.40 is preserved for rollback; gameplay settings,
cursor source diagnostic tests, camera yaw, zoom, height, horse, HUD,
F1/F6 and skip intro remain unchanged. The build ZIP keeps four files at
root, noncumulative logs, no public release before user validation.

## V0.42 - Cleanup and READ-ONLY reticle root-cause instrumentation (TEST)

**User result:** V0.41 automatic F5 replay did not fix the cross and is
an undesirable workaround. User asked to remove leftover useless experiments
and investigate the actual mechanism causing the cross after save-load.

Audit of code vs V0.38/V0.40:
- V0.41 AutoReticleRefreshOnLoad and its delayed focus pulse scheduler,
  state, INI, overlay toggle, config and runtime plumbing: REMOVED.
- V0.40 CrossCursorTestMode 1/2, which were never exercised in supplied
  logs and would only mask symptoms: REMOVED.
- Old INI keys AutoReticleRefreshOnLoad/CrossCursorTestMode are deleted on
  next normal config save. Existing INI revision stays unchanged.
- Preserve VALIDATED Hide Reticle ON/OFF including F6, the native cursor
  visibility hook and Win32 SetCursor suppression only when Hide Reticle ON.
- Preserve manual F5 (user confirms it clears the cross) but NEVER trigger
  it automatically. It is an opt-in A/B control for the diagnostic.
- Preserve Alt-Tab focus handling, lazy ImGui, verified camera/yaw/zoom,
  horse pointer safety, HUD, intro skip, movement and all other features.
- Legacy ThirdPerson / other inactive config keys remain for backward
  compatibility: do not silently remove user-requested saved settings.
- Native cursor visibility remains read-only except existing Hide Reticle.
  With Hide Reticle OFF the diagnostics NEVER change SetCursor's output.

NEW READ-ONLY DIAGNOSTIC:
- Sample GetCursorInfo every ~350ms while rendering. On change (cursor
  handle, showing flags, game focus), log desktop cursor handle, flags,
  foreground, mouse position, GetIconInfo hotspot and bitmap dimensions,
  clipping and last Win32 requested handle. Release icon bitmaps immediately.
- Existing SetCursor hook, on first <=40 requested-handle transitions, logs
  calling thread, return address and game exe relative caller RVA. These
  pinpoint which code path requested the cursor after loading.
- Correlate with native UAirshipUIManager::IsCursorVisible state changes.
- Snapshot before manual F5 and after the paired cycle, and across
  real Alt-Tab transitions; no keypress or focus generated by the probe.

TEST PROCEDURE: keep HideReticle OFF and never open overlay until after the
cross appears. Load save, observe cross for several seconds; then do one
real Alt-Tab out-and-back, see whether cross disappears; optionally press
manual F5, then exit and send noncumulative DarksidersGenesisMod.log.
Ideally also compare whether the cross appears with all mod binaries
temporarily absent, to distinguish a native game bug from mod interaction.
Do not attribute the root cause before comparing code RVA/state transitions.
No public release until validated. ZIP files at root.

## V0.43 - Skip Logos attachment bypass implicated in malformed cursor (TEST)

User discovered cross appears after save load when Skip Logos is enabled.
The earlier V0.19C patch at RVA 0x260244 jumps to 0x260257, avoiding
SStartupScreens attachment to MoviePlayer. This bypass was initially
validated for faster boot and independent Skip Intro cinematic behavior,
not for the lifecycle of Slate input/focus/cursor in later levels.
It is a STRONG causal lead, not yet proof of which cleanup call is missing.

This build DOES NOT introduce another cursor workaround or speculate a
replacement low-level patch. It preserves the V0.42 removal of automatic
F5 and abandoned cursor mode 1/2 experiments, and passive cursor traces.
It preserves working Hide Reticle ON/OFF and F6, camera, HUD, horse, etc.

Safe-by-default, controlled A/B:
- Fresh INI SkipLogos=0; SkipIntroVideos remains independent and ON.
- Bump config revision 2101 -> 2102. Migrates existing INI with ONLY
  SkipLogos forced OFF; other settings preserved.
- CRITICAL: earliest proxy checks config revision BEFORE the ASI loads;
  old revisions cannot enable the attachment bypass on that first boot.
- Explicit SkipLogos=1 after migration can still activate old V0.19C
  for A/B if needed, with warning in GUI and loader/ASI log.
- SkipLogos=0 leaves vanilla MoviePlayer attachment intact.
- Changing either option affects startup on NEXT game launch only.
- No new public release until tested.

Controlled test: SkipLogos OFF, restart game, load same save, check
cross without F5 or Alt-Tab. If cross absent, association confirmed;
optional second run SkipLogos ON verifies regression with otherwise
identical setup. Next engineering step is disassemble StartupScreens'
attach, playback completion and destruction paths to implement a
true native lifecycle-preserving logo skip without touching game assets.
Do not claim a permanent working Skip Logos replacement yet.

### StartupScreens root-cause audit (after V0.43)

The full audit and exact known 19-byte setup sequence are in
[docs/STARTUPSCREENS_AUDIT.md](docs/STARTUPSCREENS_AUDIT.md).
The failed logo bypass at `0x260244` skips both a call to
`0x1608B90` (probable GetMoviePlayer) and the virtual method call at
`[vtable+0x20]` (probable loading-screen setup) with `[rbp-0x78]`.
Those identities must be checked with the exact retail executable.
**User verified SkipLogos OFF removes the cross-shaped cursor.**
Retain V0.43 safe default; avoid workarounds. The game EXE is not
present among files currently accessible, so no replacement binary
patch is being claimed or published.

## V0.44 - Probe MoviePaths with the real retail EXE (TEST)

USER PROVIDED the exact 62,113,280-byte retail binary, whose SHA-256
matches 9f4702024df5eea1d51df7745b0ad1ea95b97009982f73ddc1218c53dff33d54.
Disassembly of RVA 0x25FE40..0x260257 confirms:
- settings UObject array at +0x38 contains `StartupMovies`;
- each entry in that TArray is a 16-byte UE FString;
- the compiled startup code copies it into `FLoadingScreenAttributes`
  at [rbp-0x68], count [rbp-0x60], and passes attributes at
  [rbp-0x78] to a virtual MoviePlayer method;
- the getter call at 0x260244 resolves to 0x1608B90 and virtual
  call at 0x260253 uses [vtable+0x20]. With the original 19 bytes
  present, the native call sequence remains intact.

V0.44 has a **strictly opt-in, one-shot diagnostic probe**, not a new
logo skip. Fresh test INI [Diagnostics] StartupMovieProbe=1. Remove
or set 0 to return to fully unmodified native startup (V0.43 behavior).
It uses an exact-byte-verified 19-byte trampoline at RVA 0x260244,
and replays all original calls byte-for-byte before 0x260257. The
pre-call C++ observer reads MoviePaths TArray entries without writing
to them, bounding all lengths and page accesses with VirtualQuery.
It logs names, count, and minimum loading-screen time in
DarksidersGenesisLoader.log. Diagnostic is disabled when legacy
SkipLogos=1 because that legacy code is already proven to cause the
cursor regression. An in-game attempt to enable SkipLogos while probe
is installed fails closed until a restart with probe disabled.

***Do not call this a Skip Logos fix.*** No logo suppression occurs.
The purpose is to identify the exact runtime playlist names, allowing
a later targeted plan that preserves native MoviePlayer attachment.
The default distribution enables the probe for a one-time test, but
the proxy defaults it OFF for older INIs that lack the key. Hide
Reticle ON/OFF, F6, camera, horses, HUD, intro skip, and all other
features remain unchanged. If the probe causes a crash, disable
StartupMovieProbe=0 and restore V0.43; do not ship as stable release.
No synthetic F5, focus or Win32 cursor manipulation is introduced.
Log is per-run (loader also resets per-run).

## V0.45 - ABORT unsafe StartupMovieProbe trampoline; restore safe baseline

**User-reported crash** with V0.44. Supplied loader log shows that
`StartupMovieProbe V0.44: ... trampoline ACTIVE` was written, while no
`StartupMovieProbe ... item` or `call=` entry appeared. ASI log reaches
early core init but ends before normal shutdown. This strongly implicates
the new mid-function trampoline; no crash dump or exception address
was supplied, so precise failing instruction is **not proven**.

Root engineering mistake: V0.44 diagnostic was described as read-only
because it did not modify `FLoadingScreenAttributes`, but it patched
**19 bytes of executable instructions** and redirected execution to
a manually built x64 thunk. That is intrusive and unsafe without
unwind registration, thorough calling-convention tests and execution
validation. Do not reintroduce it as an "observation-only" technique.

**V0.45 removes the entire V0.44 trampoline and observer** from the
DXGI proxy and restores exactly the proven V0.43 proxy source.
New INI omits `[Diagnostics] StartupMovieProbe`. If an old INI still
contains `StartupMovieProbe=1`, the V0.45 proxy deliberately ignores
that retired key, so an old INI cannot reactivate the probe. Keep
`SkipLogos=0` as the safe startup default. The historic bypass at
`0x260244` remains *explicitly opt-in* and not fixed; turning it ON
can reintroduce the cross-shaped cursor as previously confirmed.
`SkipIntroVideos` remains independent.

This is **safety rollback, not a repaired Skip Logos**. Reticle/F6,
camera, HUD, horses and all other gameplay code are left unchanged.
No automatic F5, synthetic focus or cursor masking reintroduced.
The live exe remains unmodified by the probe with SkipLogos OFF.

Next investigation route: inspect `StartupScreens` defaults and the
actual movie/config resources offline (for example the game's
`DefaultGame.ini`, `StartupScreens` settings, or the original game
`.pak` assets). Prefer content-/descriptor-level, logo-only changes
without bypassing `MoviePlayer::SetupLoadingScreen`; any runtime hook
requires separate safety audit. No public stable release from this
test until user validates V0.45 startup.

## V0.45 runtime validation from user logs (2026-10-09)

The user supplied both Loader and ASI logs for the V0.45 test session
(start 13:51:40, clean shutdown at 13:52:42):
- DXGI proxy logs "V0.43 SAFE: native MoviePlayer startup attachment preserved",
  and loads the ASI successfully.
- ASI logs "0.45-no-trampoline-safe-startup" with supported exact EXE
  SHA-256 and Skip Logos patched=0 enabled=0.
- D3D11, Camera, Horse, Reticle, HUD, Movement, Recovery and Damage
  hooks report ready; player detected; in-game combat and native
  cursor transitions are recorded.
- Ends with "Shutdown: complete", no crash recorded in these logs.
- The user did not explicitly describe the visual appearance of the
  reticle in this V0.45 session: do not claim visual revalidation
  from native-cursor visibility alone.
- In contrast, V0.44 opt-in early trampoline showed StartupMovieProbe
  ACTIVE and caused a startup crash. The implementation is removed
  in V0.45: never resurrect it.

Next engineering step: target the logos selectively while preserving
SStartupScreens and the native MoviePlayer attachment/lifecycle.
No automatic F5, synthetic focus, disabled startup module, globally
emptied startup movies or unsafe mid-function trampoline.
Public stable release remains unchanged.

### Native StartupScreens continuation, verified logo identities

The exact game EXE and public PC-specific guides support further
analysis recorded in [docs/STARTUPSCREENS_AUDIT.md](docs/STARTUPSCREENS_AUDIT.md):
logo files are `THQ_LogoBasic.mp4` and `AS_LogoBasic.mp4`;
`CG_Intro_LowVi.mp4` is separate. Unlike a config-file rename,
the desired mod must remain ASI-only. The file stems are absent from
the matching EXE; only reflected settings/array fields are present.
The actual runtime movie list is unknown without inspecting the
game's cooked config/resources. V0.45 is unchanged and safe with
`SkipLogos=0`. No speculative patch is permitted.

## V0.46 - Experimental exact-name first-two StartupMovies filter (TEST)

Goal: bring back Skip Logos without touching the native MoviePlayer setup
and without altering game assets. Continue directly from V0.45 stable
safe startup. V0.44's crashing 19-byte MoviePlayer wrapper remains gone.

SOURCE: The user-supplied retail executable was verified against
62,113,280 bytes and SHA256
9f4702024df5eea1d51df7745b0ad1ea95b97009982f73ddc1218c53dff33d54.
RVA 0x25FF31 contains exactly:
44 8B 76 08 (mov r14d,[rsi+8], array count)
48 8B 36    (mov rsi,[rsi], array descriptor pointer).
The game's unmodified 19 bytes at RVA 0x260244 are independently
validated and NEVER changed by this version.

V0.46 uses an early 7-byte exact-signature redirect at RVA 0x25FF31.
A nearby executable island replays those original two instructions,
saves flags and all volatile GP registers, allocates the Win64 32-byte
shadow space and calls a bounded validator. The validator reads at most
3 names with VirtualQuery guards and logs them to the Loader log.
Only if first two FString descriptors name THQ_LogoBasic and AS_LogoBasic
in either order, count is 3..64 and all relevant buffers are readable
does the island increase RSI by 32 (skip two 16-byte descriptors) and
decrease R14D by 2. This preserves the third and subsequent entries.
In all other circumstances the ORIGINAL full playlist is passed on.
The island restores original registers/flags and uses a RIP-indirect
absolute jump back at RVA 0x25FF38, not clobbering RAX.

The following native code deep-copies the resulting descriptors and
calls the ORIGINAL SetupLoadingScreen vtable method. Unlike the
V0.19C failed attachment bypass, this retains the MoviePlayer/Slate
startup path and original cleanup ownership. It is nonetheless an
experimental early executable detour; crash-free behavior is NOT
proven. On crash use V0.45 or SkipLogos=0 (fresh startup required).

Fresh TEST ZIP includes SkipLogos=1 to exercise the new mechanism.
Existing INIs are preserved and V0.45 users must explicitly change
SkipLogos=0 to 1 to test it. Missing/old INIs do not automatically
enable it. The old V0.19C attachment bypass is removed entirely from
the proxy; it cannot be invoked by this build. Skip Intro remains
controlled by g.PlayIntroCinematicOnBoot and unaffected by code changes.

If the named logo files are NOT the first two native entries, the
validator logs FAIL OPEN and the logos still show. This is intentional
rather than guessing. Future builds may expand to name-matching in
arbitrary positions after observing real runtime ordering.

TEST GATE: startup with new proxy, log messages in
DarksidersGenesisLoader.log, logos skipped or not, warning display,
intro with SkipIntroVideos OFF, in-game cursor after save load,
Alt-Tab and overlay; do not publish a public tagged release before
user validates. Files at ZIP root. No new auto F5/focus simulations.

## V0.47 - Unified compact log, with ALL gameplay features unchanged (TEST)

User requested **one** log containing essentials, instead of two logs.
This revision modifies only diagnostic output and its filenames.
New per-session canonical filename: `DarksidersGenesisMod.log`.

- DXGI proxy creates/truncates the canonical logfile on the first
  loader event. It logs only early Skip Logos decisions, relevant
  prefix-filter matches/mismatches, ASI load result and errors.
- The proxy deletes the obsolete `DarksidersGenesisLoader.log` if
  present, to avoid confusing next-run stale results.
- Proxy exports `DGUnifiedLogActive` so the ASI can append to the
  existing log rather than erasing early events in `ResetLogFile`.
  If the proxy is unavailable, ASI retains its independent log reset.
- ASI suppresses old, high-volume cursor snapshots, repeated focus,
  camera trace frames, rejected movement-candidate dumps and raw
  repeated HorseCharacter capture traces. It keeps hooks' READY/FAILED,
  exact supported game fingerprint, player capture, setting changes,
  overlay actions, single first combat samples and clean shutdown.
- These filters affect **messages only**. The camera/horse/reticle
  hooks and event semantics are untouched. No new focus workaround.
- New version label V0.47; INI remains unchanged. Current V0.46
  experimental logo-prefix filter is preserved verbatim, not reworked.
- IMPORTANT: user's uploaded logs at 15:03 were still from V0.45,
  so they do not validate V0.46's experimental Skip Logos.
- Keep public release unchanged pending user tests of V0.47.

## V0.48 - Preserve old Loader.log files (requested correction)

V0.47 introduced a single log but unnecessarily deleted the existing
`DarksidersGenesisLoader.log` on process attach. **V0.48 removes that
DeleteFileW operation and its related stale-file path entirely.**
From now on the mod does not CREATE, WRITE, RESET or DELETE
`DarksidersGenesisLoader.log`. An existing old loader log is preserved
byte-for-byte on disk. It is historical data, not an active logfile.

All early proxy and ASI events still go to the single per-session
`DarksidersGenesisMod.log`; the proxy truncates only that file once
per game launch and the ASI appends without discarding early events.
Compact filtering, settings, hooks and the V0.46 experimental selective
Skip Logos implementation remain unchanged. Build uses the existing
root-level four-file ZIP layout; no public tagged release until tested.

## V0.49: user log proves runtime StartupMovies count=2, not 3

V0.47 runtime session on Oct 9 at 15:13 (NOT a V0.48 binary)
shows that the early RVA 0x25FF31 hook executed as intended without a
crash. Log from the existing unified Mod.log:
- "Skip Logos V0.46: exact-name prefix filter requested"
- "exact 7-byte startup copy hook installed"
- ASI reports 0.47-unified-compact-log.
- At native call: "StartupMovies count=2 validPtr=1"
- V0.46 incorrectly logs "FAIL OPEN, unexpected movie count or array",
  because count < 3 is hard-rejected BEFORE logging names.
- Session shuts down normally.

Critical constraint: V0.19B already tried copying a zero-count
StartupMovies array. That experiment removed the independently
controlled intro as well as logos. A naive V0.49 count>=2 change
would repeat that regression, so it is specifically NOT done.

V0.49 extends the existing non-mutating native diagnostic to
allow count=2 for *name reading* while still refusing to empty
the movie array. It prints the two FString entries and whether
they EXACTLY identify THQ_LogoBasic and AS_LogoBasic. If there
are only two entries, even an exact match returns false so the
original native video array and MoviePlayer path remain intact.
The original >2 filter behavior is unchanged. Result is a
focused investigation build, NOT a complete Skip Logos fix.
It preserves V0.48 single Mod.log with compact output, never
creates/deletes/touches any old Loader.log, and contains the
same cumulative gameplay features. When names are confirmed,
research a logo-skip mechanism that keeps the native
MoviePlayer and intro lifecycle (not count-zero, skipping
attachment, or early-function RET patch).

Public release remains unchanged. User should install both
dxgi.dll and ASI from the V0.49 test archive (four files at ZIP
root), launch with SkipLogos=1, then provide only
DarksidersGenesisMod.log.
